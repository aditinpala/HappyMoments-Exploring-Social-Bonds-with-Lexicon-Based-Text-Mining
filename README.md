Exploring Social Relationships in Happy Moments: A Lexicon-based Text Mining Analysis

**Data**
HappyDB is a corpus of 100,000+ crowd-sourced descriptions of happy moments. HappyDB is available on GitHub [1]. The cleaned data set is located at [2].

**Task (10 points in total; four subtasks, 25% each)**

(1)	HappyDB provided a “people dictionary” [3], which is a lexicon of common social relationships. Use this lexicon to find the top three social relationships mentioned in happy moments, e.g. spouse, parents, children, friends, or someone else.

(2)	Use your world knowledge to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the “people dictionary” in terms of answering the question “with whom do people spend happy moments?” You can define “people”, “strength” and “weakness” in your own way here. If you think this dictionary is already perfect, you can articulate your argument and skip task #3 instead.

(3)	Modify the “people dictionary” to fix the weaknesses that you have identified. Use the revised lexicon to redo task #1.

(4)	Extract five context words before and after the most mentioned people, sort by frequency, and explore patterns in the 100 most frequent context words, for example, any words indicating activities that people do in happy moments?
